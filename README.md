# Library-Management-System
This project is a console-based Java application developed using Eclipse IDE. It simulates a basic library management system, allowing users to perform key operations such as issuing and returning books through an interactive Command-Line Interface (CLI).The system is designed using object-oriented principles and structured with multiple Java classes to represent books, users, and the library itself.
